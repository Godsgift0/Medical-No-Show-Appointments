# Medical-No-Show-Appointments

## Overview
A missed appointment is more than just a missed opportunity. When a patients doesn't show up on time, it affects people who could've been treated instead. As Kim Decker, chief of the Martin Army Community Hospital Healthcare Management Division, puts it:

> An appointment missed by you is an appointment missed by two.

No-shows occur when a patient fails to attend a scheduled appointment without notifying the healthcare provider in advance. The negative consequences of high no-shows are numerous and affect not only healthcare providers but also patients who miss their appointments.Some of these consequences include: 

* For Patient: Discontinuation of care, increased and sometimes inappropriate admissions to Emergency Room (ER) services for the patient.
* For Other Patients: Their access is restricted, which can lead to dissatisfaction among patients, as well as suboptimal care outcomes. 
* For The Hospital: It results in lost revenue and thus profit for the hospital, there is also higher inefficiencies in the scheduling system, and an increase in outpatient waiting time.

## Analysis
In this project, I analyzed and communicated my findings about a Medical No-show Appointment dataset, using Python libraries. I found out how different factors affected no-show rate and their relevance in predicting if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment.
